In my opinion, this project can be improved if...

1. Shafts and grips can be objects

ex) class Shaft:
        def __init__(self, name, flex, length):...

    class Grip:
        def __init__(self, name, thickness, color):...


2. Methods 'option_1' and 'option_2' has almost same structure (not efficient). However, the parameter is different, so I divide into two different methods.

3. Comments are long and should be clearly explained (other programmers might be confused if my comments are too long).
