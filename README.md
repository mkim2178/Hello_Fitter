# Hello_Fitter
Hello! This is my first programming project with using Python.
This is an unprofitable programming project. I don't gain any money through this program.
I also did not use any GUI frameworks to visualize this program (I will work on this one day).
However, you can try it from your terminal or any type of IDE that supports Python!


I got inspired by these websites:
